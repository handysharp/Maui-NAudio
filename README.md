# Maui-NAudio
/// Program is a .NetMAUI version of the console app at the url below:
/// http://truelogic.org/wordpress/2021/01/28/using-midi-with-naudio/
/// /// I have input the console version from the site above and it works. When a "midi in" message occurs from a keyboard, it goes to midiIn_MessageReceived(). But, with this version it does not go to that method and nothing prints out. I am not sure if my collectionview code is correct, but it is hard to tell without the midi info passing to it.
